        Common-draw games played in multiplayer lobbies, in crash games players wager on a virtual element (like the plane in Aviator) whose value increases over time until it abruptly crashes. The thrill lies in strategically cashing out before the crash to multiply your bet, creating a unique blend of risk and reward.
        
        While the decision on when to cash out is entirely at the individual player's discretion, the 'crash' time is the same for every player in the lobby.`,

          For players who enjoy a bit more strategy, there's the double bet option. You can choose to play it safe with one bet, cashing out earlier for a guaranteed return. The other bet allows you to aim for a higher multiplier and potentially bigger wins.
          
          The key to success in Aviator remains constant: a well-timed cash out before the plane disappears multiplies your bet and secures your win.`,
